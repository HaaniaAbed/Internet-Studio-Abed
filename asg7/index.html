    <h3>Biography & Background</h3>   
	<p>In the movie, “The Great Wall”, Commander Lin Mae is the Commander of the only all female division for the Nameless Order. Commander Lin Mae plays a pivotal role in the movie as the second lead, as she uses her warfare intellect and calculative skills to defeat the Tao Tei- which are a rapidly multiplying mythical alien race of creatures who come upon the Great Wall of China every 50 years, trying to eat the world. As the film goes on, she reveals that she became a part of the Nameless order (the secret army whose sole purpose is to eradicate the threat at Great Wall of China to save the world) when she was 7 years old. As she grew, she surpassed her peers, and started the Crane Corps, which was a division composed of all women as a way to pave the way for women to be able to be more than the 11th century gender roles, and able to receive the opportunity to save their world. In the middle of the film after a turning point where she utilizes her intellect to attempt to save the general of the army and the rest of the soldiers on duty, she becomes the first female general of the Nameless Order, in 11th century China.

	<h3>Reasoning:</h3>  
	<p>Commander Lin Mae would be a great ruler due to her advanced intellect and problem solving skills under stress, but also mainly because of her morals and values of empathy and trust. One of the main themes of the movie was “Xi Ren” which meant “trust”. She taught the main character how to trust, thus making him a crucial ally in their mission to ultimately save the world. She would be able to maintain good contact with other nations, deal with high stress situations valiantly, and boost equality for all people (regardless of gender especially). She also studied multiple languages and expressed a desire to learn more about beyond the wall, making her more open minded than a lot of politicians, despite the fact that she too in the end, became a warfare politician of 11th century china.
