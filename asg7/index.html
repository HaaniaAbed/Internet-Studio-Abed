    <h3>Biography & Background</h3>   
	<p>In the movie, “The Great Wall”, Commander Lin Mae is the Commander of the only all female division for the Nameless Order. Commander Lin Mae plays a pivotal role in the movie as the second lead, as she uses her warfare intellect and calculative skills to defeat the Tao Tei- which are a rapidly multiplying mythical alien race of creatures who come upon the Great Wall of China every 50 years, trying to eat the world. As the film goes on, she reveals that she became a part of the Nameless order (the secret army whose sole purpose is to eradicate the threat at Great Wall of China to save the world) when she was 7 years old. As she grew, she surpassed her peers, and started the Crane Corps, which was a division composed of all women as a way to pave the way for women to be able to be more than the 11th century gender roles, and able to receive the opportunity to save their world. In the middle of the film after a turning point where she utilizes her intellect to attempt to save the general of the army and the rest of the soldiers on duty, she becomes the first female general of the Nameless Order, in 11th century China.
