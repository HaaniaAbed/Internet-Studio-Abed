	<p>I personally would choose to create an annotated wireframe due to my copious amounts of ideas for all of the differing directions which my project could flow in. For my perspective, the idea of being able to create a basic wireframe, but taking it to a level above with the utilization of annotations to aid with the specifics of how the user can interact with different parts, would aid significantly in feeling like more a 2D easy-to-follow along visual thatâ€™s surface level enough to lay out a clear plan for me to follow along in the creation process, but detailed enough to address the specifics ahead of time before the prototype. However, later on after creating the annotated wireframe, I may decide to create it in more of the format of a slight userflow inclusion if I determine it as needed. Although, it is crucial to note that this step will only be when I am actually creating the actual prototype itself as a way to simply expand upon my base visualization from the original mental-clarity giving annotated wireframe design. </p>
