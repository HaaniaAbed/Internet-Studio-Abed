	<h1>Statement</h1>
	<p>For my primary h1 tag, I chose the font “My Soul” due to its visual qualities of a sophisticated Script font for the titles. Due to my destination being a technologically advanced fantasy-like Empire, I personally found it to be quite fitting of the theme to have my primary heading for each page within this project, reflecting a similar theme as the setting. As for the other subheading and the paragraph text fonts (Almendra and Markazi Text respectfully), I chose these two to support the fantasy-like feel along with the formal and royal feel of the status of this destination being an Empire. 
<br>As for the images which I have used throughout this website as a visual of each of the activities or restaurants, I went through and decided to have each image reflect a bright and colorful scheme to express the goodness through light motif of this Empire so the viewers of this website can feel the idea behind this Empire, without having to have much previously acquired background knowledge over this Empire’s significance and special qualities. 

<br>Additionally, I actually was the one who made up the idea of this Empire so all of the text and wordbuilding was done entirely original, along with the hero image. The large hero image on the homepage was a fun collaboration project between my friend Andrea and I a while back, with her responsible for creating the base drawing of the Emperor from my descriptions and idea sketches, and I was the one who added the special effects like lighting and shadows. As for the animation colors on the buttons especially and the general color palette of the webpages, I decided to draw from the colors which were present in my friend’s portrait of the emperor and have the colors be similar, as a way to make the colors seem uniform. Additionally, like I did with the images for the restaurants and activities, I continued the similar motif of the goodness through light throughout the choosing of the background image, to add to the uniform look of my webpages. 

<br>As for the sizing of the text, I chose to have the heading be the largest so it’s one of the first qualities which catches the viewer’s attention. To aid with these efforts of initially drawing the viewer’s attention to the top of each page first, I decided to also have the menu boxes connecting to each webpage all in a row-like direction to ensure that the top looks like a solid section that isn’t too confusing or packed for the viewer’s eye. Lastly, I created the sidebar for the provinces on the homepage to provide a unique information visual that immediately captures the viewer’s attention from the regular text as they scroll down to read the page, after initially seeing the top portion with the title and menu buttons to the other pages. <p>
