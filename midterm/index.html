	<h1>Serkan Empire</h1>
	<p>Overview: This is the native land of the Itri, the place where the sun always shines. The nights are never fully dark. This kingdom has the richest display of nature in all the lands, with bright trees, full grasses, and precious metals laying in abundance just below the surface. Ariunzule is enforced by technological wonders between all the realms. On the outskirts of Ariunzule, they have great bridges connecting them to their neighboring territories.
		Locals: <em>The Itri</em><br />
				Strengths: They are most powerful in the daytime and they can also purify things using the power of the sun.
		<br />Fun Facts: Most Itri have trouble using their powers when the sun goes down; although, using their knowledge of advanced technology, they can make lanterns that simulate sunlight in case an Itri needs to venture outside the borders of the Kingdom during night.
		<br />Food Source: Itri can make dishes out of vegetables and meats for additional nutrition but they can also absorb light as a means to energize themselves.
	   <br />Common Physical Features: They generally have very light colored eyes that glow when they use their powers.
