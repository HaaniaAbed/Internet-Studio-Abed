	<h3>Summary:</h3>
	<p>Originally before my friend and I had a conversation regarding their thoughts over my domain names, I was having a lot of trouble with figuring out what the third one should be, because none of my many ideas for the third one was as strong as the first two. I initially explored ideas such as “mvrk” as a shortened form of “maverick” and so I reached upon options such as “mvrkguide.digital” and “menumvrk.digital”. After reviewing the four best ideas of names with my friend, she mentioned that I could also take the double “M”s at the start of “Menu Maverick” and turn it into “mmguide” so it also sounds like it’s food related, due to the “mm” before it, which is a common expression of food related satisfaction. We both then pulled up the search bar to find if there were any “mmguide” options available and we indeed did find a few; however, they all had an “s” added in, so it would be “mmgs” instead. As a result, we decided to keep that as a reasonable third option, but my friend highly suggested that I should ultimately go with an option that has the full name as best as possible, so it clearly would be an accurate representation of my website’s name. Ultimately, she highly suggested going with the “themenumaverickguide.digital” option to sound more professional.

	<h3>Personal Preference</h3>
	<p>After speaking with my friend and hearing out the points she made and the advice she provided, I personally prefer “menumavericksguide.digital” because of her point of having the name trying the best to exactly represent my website, if I have the option available to. Unfortunately, I’m not planning to name my website with a “the” in front, and will just have “Menu Maverick’s Guide” as the title, so having the domain name be an exact representation of the full name (minus the apostrophe) would be the most accurate and clear signal to viewers of which one is my website. Additionally, I also took a look at all of the endings such as “.digital” and “.life” which I got the options to go with, and after much research of the “.digital” ending, I found that it’s mainly useful for tech companies and digital agencies, as well as, bloggers, content creators, and creators of digital products or services. So, as a result, I found that if I were to go with the “.digital” options, it would indicate that my website is highly technologically tied and is general enough to support my idea of having my website be a digital blog-like service for the users, that is based highly within technology. In conclusion, the domain name “menumavericksguide.digital”, would reflect the technological aspects of the direction of my website, and has the full name of in there so it would be clearly recognizable for the users to remember and search for, whenever they feel like they’d wish to use this app.
