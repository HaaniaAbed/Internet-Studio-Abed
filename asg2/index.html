	<h1>Assignment I</h1>
	  <ol>
          <li><em>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</em><br />Primarily, Structured Content is more so the information itself- which is framed like as articles, recipes, product descriptions, profiles, and how-to’s, which deal with the hierarchy of the content for the viewers to see. Semantic HTML, on the other hand, hierarchizes the information within the code itself, such as code lists or heading tags like "h1” & “li” , which allows for both the people and the algorithms can recognize them as elements which are both defined and interpretable. 
            <br />Additionally, Structured Content is generally explicitly defined and described between the various chunks of content data so as a result, which allows for the algorithm to be able to legibly interpret the code in a way that allows it to find and shoot out answers by being able to target specific related areas to search between the database. While, Semantic generally acts to communicate information between just the document elements themselves, rather than just describing how they should appear on screen.</li>
		  <li><em>How do they work together?</em><br />Overall, they can work together to combine their particular areas of coverage to create a hierarchical format for both the code and information, that is efficient for both the algorithm and people to view at. For, the semantic will be mostly working to categorize the information of the code itself, whilst the structured content will act similarly to a blueprint of how the information should be organized in order to give out targeted information to the viewers. With these two working together, the information itself and within the code will be having the shared characteristics of semantic’s defined interpretability and the structured content’s explicitly defined legibility.</li>
              <li><em>Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?</em> words </li>

   <h2>Semester Project Idea</h2>
     <p>For my semester project, I really got inspired from the Single Plate website example mentioned in class, except I really wish there was a version of that where one can modify the results to their needs. <br />For, since there is a whole world full of different cultures, religions, allergies, specific dietary needs, and eating disorders which can all play a part on the acceptance of specific ingredients in recipes, I wish to bring the idea of my semester project in the direction of being able to cater for primarily those who cannot eat certain foods or ingredients for mainly all of these reasons mentioned above. I would also like to have a either a page on the side or perhaps some customizable options so every individual user can interact by selecting the name of the certain diet they are doing, eating disorder/ food sensitivities (such as ARFIDS), the type of allergies or intolerances they may have, or even the type of religion they follow which has a few restrictions on the food the user can eat. With this, I’m thinking of helping the user be able to more efficiently find recipes that they can either take and swap out ingredients so it’ll work for them or even just plainly providing a database of names of dishes that they can safely eat without having to worry about whether or not something as crucial as food won’t be a comfortable experience for them.
