	<h2>Conversations with Robots: Voice, Smart Agents & the Case for Structured Content</h2>

          <li><em>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</em><br /><br />Primarily, Structured Content is more so the information itself- which is framed like as articles, recipes, product descriptions, profiles, and how-to’s, which deal with the hierarchy of the content for the viewers to see. Semantic HTML, on the other hand, hierarchizes the information within the code itself, such as code lists or heading tags like "h1” & “li” , which allows for both the people and the algorithms can recognize them as elements which are both defined and interpretable. 
            <br />Additionally, Structured Content is generally explicitly defined and described between the various chunks of content data so as a result, which allows for the algorithm to be able to legibly interpret the code in a way that allows it to find and shoot out answers by being able to target specific related areas to search between the database. While, Semantic generally acts to communicate information between just the document elements themselves, rather than just describing how they should appear on screen.</li>
		  <br /><li><em>How do they work together?</em><br /><br />Overall, they can work together to combine their particular areas of coverage to create a hierarchical format for both the code and information, that is efficient for both the algorithm and people to view at. For, the semantic will be mostly working to categorize the information of the code itself, whilst the structured content will act similarly to a blueprint of how the information should be organized in order to give out targeted information to the viewers. With these two working together, the information itself and within the code will be having the shared characteristics of semantic’s defined interpretability and the structured content’s explicitly defined legibility.</li>
