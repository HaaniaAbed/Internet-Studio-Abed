	<h1>Week 2</h1>
	<h2>Conversations with Robots: Voice, Smart Agents & the Case for Structured Content</h2>
	  <ol>
          <li><em>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</em><br /><br />Primarily, Structured Content is more so the information itself- which is framed like as articles, recipes, product descriptions, profiles, and how-to’s, which deal with the hierarchy of the content for the viewers to see. Semantic HTML, on the other hand, hierarchizes the information within the code itself, such as code lists or heading tags like "h1” & “li” , which allows for both the people and the algorithms can recognize them as elements which are both defined and interpretable. 
            <br />Additionally, Structured Content is generally explicitly defined and described between the various chunks of content data so as a result, which allows for the algorithm to be able to legibly interpret the code in a way that allows it to find and shoot out answers by being able to target specific related areas to search between the database. While, Semantic generally acts to communicate information between just the document elements themselves, rather than just describing how they should appear on screen.</li>
		  <br /><li><em>How do they work together?</em><br /><br />Overall, they can work together to combine their particular areas of coverage to create a hierarchical format for both the code and information, that is efficient for both the algorithm and people to view at. For, the semantic will be mostly working to categorize the information of the code itself, whilst the structured content will act similarly to a blueprint of how the information should be organized in order to give out targeted information to the viewers. With these two working together, the information itself and within the code will be having the shared characteristics of semantic’s defined interpretability and the structured content’s explicitly defined legibility.</li>

		 <li><em>Denise Jacobs argues that we all have a troll-like inner critic. Of the methods she identifies to banish this troll, which would be most successful for you? Why?</em><br /><br />Honestly, to me personally, the method which would act as the most successful would be the “Showing Some Love” method. For, I feel like at least for me, it is quite easy to be mean to yourself, whether you are criticizing your inner thoughts as a form of low self esteem or when one is feeling significant negative emotions which may make one believe that it’s all their fault as a way to find a scapegoat. However, just as how a kind comment can make someone’s day to just about anyone else, I truly believe that acting in a kind way to yourself can overall significantly improve your mindset for the positive. Additionally, I’ve also found that in the past, whenever I’ve tried to shoo away the troll-like inner critic with just insults or ignoring, it’s remained like a pest that insists that you listen to it. On the other hand, a slight positive acknowledgement over the effort that the troll-like inner critic is doing to warn or even protect yourself, overall makes it go away temporarily for me because it’s so easy to fall within the pull of negativity, but positivity is more deliberate, thus impactful.</li>
	     <li><em>In David McRaney's article, what is "hyperbolic discounting"? List one method McRaney identifies to counteract hyperbolic discounting. Which would work best for you?</em><br /><br />words</li>
	     <li><em>Critical Web Design addresses four types of power in networks. As you learn web publishing fundamentals, what network-making power do you (or don't you) have as the creator and publisher of your work?</em>words</li>
