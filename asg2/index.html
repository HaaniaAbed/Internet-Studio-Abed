	<h1>Week 2</h1>
	<h2>Conversations with Robots: Voice, Smart Agents & the Case for Structured Content</h2>
	  <ol>
          <li><em>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</em><br /><br />Primarily, Structured Content is more so the information itself- which is framed like as articles, recipes, product descriptions, profiles, and how-to’s, which deal with the hierarchy of the content for the viewers to see. Semantic HTML, on the other hand, hierarchizes the information within the code itself, such as code lists or heading tags like "h1” & “li” , which allows for both the people and the algorithms can recognize them as elements which are both defined and interpretable. 
            <br />Additionally, Structured Content is generally explicitly defined and described between the various chunks of content data so as a result, which allows for the algorithm to be able to legibly interpret the code in a way that allows it to find and shoot out answers by being able to target specific related areas to search between the database. While, Semantic generally acts to communicate information between just the document elements themselves, rather than just describing how they should appear on screen.</li>
		  <br /><li><em>How do they work together?</em><br /><br />Overall, they can work together to combine their particular areas of coverage to create a hierarchical format for both the code and information, that is efficient for both the algorithm and people to view at. For, the semantic will be mostly working to categorize the information of the code itself, whilst the structured content will act similarly to a blueprint of how the information should be organized in order to give out targeted information to the viewers. With these two working together, the information itself and within the code will be having the shared characteristics of semantic’s defined interpretability and the structured content’s explicitly defined legibility.</li>
              <br /><li><em>Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?</em><br /><br />It’s crucial to have both semantic HTML and Structured Content in the web pages mainly for the very same reasons mentioned in the previous question above because they both are quite helpful in creating an end result that has both of the qualities: such as the Structured Content’s ability to give out targeted answers which are tailored by having an explicit categorized order of the information and the Semantic HTML’s allowance for interpretability in mostly the behind the scenes code which sets the groundwork for both people and algorithms alike to go through and recognize the elements. Also, like the intro of the article also mentioned, “by focusing on providing access to information in a structured, systematic way that is legible to both humans and machines, content publishers can ensure that their content is both accessible and accurate in these new contexts”, which enforces that it’s important to have a blend of both so the information can be both hierarchized and categorized for the viewer’s benefit, whether it is the algorithm or coder going through, or the viewer looking for answers.</li>

		 <li><em>Denise Jacobs argues that we all have a troll-like inner critic. Of the methods she identifies to banish this troll, which would be most successful for you? Why?</em><br /><br />Honestly, to me personally, the method which would act as the most successful would be the “Showing Some Love” method. For, I feel like at least for me, it is quite easy to be mean to yourself, whether you are criticizing your inner thoughts as a form of low self esteem or when one is feeling significant negative emotions which may make one believe that it’s all their fault as a way to find a scapegoat. However, just as how a kind comment can make someone’s day to just about anyone else, I truly believe that acting in a kind way to yourself can overall significantly improve your mindset for the positive. Additionally, I’ve also found that in the past, whenever I’ve tried to shoo away the troll-like inner critic with just insults or ignoring, it’s remained like a pest that insists that you listen to it. On the other hand, a slight positive acknowledgement over the effort that the troll-like inner critic is doing to warn or even protect yourself, overall makes it go away temporarily for me because it’s so easy to fall within the pull of negativity, but positivity is more deliberate, thus impactful.</li>
	     <br /><li><em>In David McRaney's article, what is "hyperbolic discounting"? List one method McRaney identifies to counteract hyperbolic discounting. Which would work best for you?</em><br /><br />As defined in David McRaney’s article, Hyperbolic Discounting is a term to describe the effect it has upon one’s mindset, which incites one to act in favor of the short term ideal, rather than abiding by the true better payout which happens more long term. In other terms, it creates a free void for the mind to put off things, so that the person doesn’t feel the pressure of the long term unless it becomes immediate, which allows for one to dismiss all of the aspects which they don’t wish to deal with in the immediate moment to later times.<br />One of the methods which was mentioned in the article, which would work the best for me, was the idea of the set-up of zones, which could significantly invoke a space to force one’s self to perform the task, instead of having it being pushed away inside of the void of hyperbolic discounting. With this, it’ll make the task seem more immediate, thus making this particular task be the better payout in the short term, as well as the long term. Additionally, setting up zones that are set for before the actual date would also work as a way to portray self control because the zones are set up knowingly to be deliberately before the actual final date, however, the work will still be completed before then from a deliberate attempt of creating this as the most crucial immediate, above all others.

	     <br /><li><em>Critical Web Design addresses four types of power in networks. As you learn web publishing fundamentals, what network-making power do you (or don't you) have as the creator and publisher of your work?</em><br /><br />As the creator of my own work, I feel like I personally wouldn’t have the 4th power (Network-making power- regarding the power which those who set up the networks have over those who use the network) all to myself as time passes on. For, in the beginning after one would put something out into the web for others to interact with, it may appear like the creator has all of the power, but there also the power that the users have over the person who creates the network. To specify more, while I may publish my work out into the void of the web, there is the audience which can influence me, the creator to adjust the work out to their specifications, and they can even wish to have the work that I would have posted taken down too, if the situation calls for it. So in a way, the creator has the power, as long as they are allowed to have the power.
