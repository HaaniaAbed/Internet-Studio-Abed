      In some versions of the comics, Damian Wayne was created to kill and replace Batman and serve as a host body for Ra's al Ghul (Leader of the League of Assasins & the Grandfather of Damian Wayne),which would unify the Wayne and al Ghul factions. Although, his backstory later got refined when it made it to on-screen with the DC Animated movie series. Damian, as a preadolescent, was then left by his mother in the care of his father, who had been unaware of his existence previously. Damian is violent, egotistical, and was trained by the League of Assassins as a weapon, learning to kill at a young age, which troubles the relationship with his father who refuses to kill. However, the Dark Knight does care for his lost progeny and continues to take care of him, even instating Damian as the new Robin.</p>
  <h3>Damian's Path to Humanity</h3>
    <p> In the movie, Batman VS Robin, the movie starts off with a rebelling Damian stealing Batman's car in the dead of the night to rescue missing children abducted by Anton Schott AKA Dollmaker, who has been brainwashing them into his "dolls". Batman rushes to the scene to join and repremand Damian, which causes Damian to question Batman's strong boundary of maintaining humanity by not killing criminals. Although,while Batman frees the children, an angry Damian confronts Anton on his own, and almost makes an attempt against Anton's life, but stops himself when he heards Batman's morals echoing in his head. However, a mysterious figure in an owl costume appears and advises him to kill Anton, tearing Anton's heart out when Damian refuses and leaving a feather behind. Batman comes across Anton's corpse and suspects Damian of killing him, due to his past violent actions and the fact that the mysterious figure was only seen by him, thus severely questioning Damian's obiedience to Batman's morals. <br><br>  Later, Bruce sees this as a sign of Damian being dangerous, thus getting prompted to place security measures around Wayne Manor to prevent him from going out as Robin without his permission. Damian escapes Wayne Manor, and while out he meets the same assassin who killed Anton. Introducing himself as Talon, he takes Damian under his wing, training him to become a Court of Owls assassin. However, in the three day duration of Talon and Damian's late night rendevois, Damian still hears Batman's voice echoing in his head, thus preventing Damian from fully taking yet another life. Fed up, Talon tries force Damian into embracing the assasin side of him, only for Batman to walk in on them both then as Talon leaves, Batman and Robin have a showdown. The fight ends in the two of them falling down mid fight and Batman protects his son from the fall. However, despite Batman's efforts to preserve his son, Damian chooses the life of an assasin with Talon.<br><br>  Afterwards the split, Bruce infiltrates the Court headquarters and is dosed by hallucinogenic gas, causing him to see a future where Damian becomes a murderous vigilante, but is again rescued by Nightwing and Alfred Pennyworth. When Damian is revealed to be Bruce's son, the Grandmaster rejects him under the decision to emotionally cripple Bruce with Damian's death, prompting Talon to attack the Court in protection of Damian (who Talon has developed a deep emotional connection to), killing several members in the process, before killing the Grandmaster. Now having control of the Court, Talon imprisons Damian for his safety and gathers an army of immortal Owls and leads an attack on Wayne Manor, but Batman, Nightwing and Alfred fend them off by freezing them.Talon then confronts Bruce in a duel and severely wounds him. Damian escapes the Court headquarters and defends Bruce from Talon, telling him he could never be a better father than Bruce. In his defeat, Talon takes his own life by forcing Damian to stab him through the neck with his own dagger. This greatly traumatizes Damian, who rejects Bruce's offer to return home, claiming that he doesn't know who he is. Bruce consoles Damian and allows him to leave, suggesting he go to a monastery in the Himalayas he once visited to find himself, which Damian accepts.
