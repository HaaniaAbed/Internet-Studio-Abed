			 <li><a href="https://theonion.com/the-onions-exclusive-interview-with-gavin-newsom/"> The Onion </a></li><br />
		     <li>With the Onion’s website, I noticed that a lot of their headers for the various types of stories such as the “Share”, “Trending”, "Recent News", “Explore Tags”, “Related Coverage”, and “Read More” are all outlined in bold with a deep green color. However, some of the other heading-like text such as "Continued on Next Page", along with a portion of the smaller subheadings (which look almost the exact same with the same bold lettering, font, and color) have a good number of them as clickable links. Additionally, a few of the small green icons next to the larger headers are also not clickable, meanwhile the small green icons which are standing alone are clickable for users.</li>

		 <li><h3><em>Framing One's Project into a Story-like Format to Refine Ideas:</em></h3>
	     <p>Through storytelling, ideas can often either begin to take root into a more static concept of a storyline- which can significantly clear up the fine direction in which one’s project will bloom into- or it can make it more clearer on what needs to be changed or removed to make the story flow more preferably, as the project ideas begins to face the challenges of formulating into a possible final product. For, like the article highlighted, stories often follow a pattern which ensures the overall success for the story, as it creates a format for the author to go in and follow as they try to reform their ideas to be as successfully attention engaging with the audience as they can. Additionally, following by the guidelines of a story-like format for one’s project ideas also allows for a clear space for one to sort through their ideas as they become more organized and refined, as well as accounts for the addition of meaningful emotion too (which is crucial to connect with both the targeted audience for the project and connects the creator to their own creation).</p></li>
