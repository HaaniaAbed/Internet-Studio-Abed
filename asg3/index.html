    <h1>Assignment 3: Article Answers & Creative Brief</h1>
	<h2>Part 2: Reading</h2>
	  <ol><li>
		      <h4><em>Website Example of Do's and Don'ts of Web Design's Violation of Number 6:</em></h4>
         <ul>
			 <li><a href="https://theonion.com/the-onions-exclusive-interview-with-gavin-newsom/"> The Onion </a></li><br />
		     <li>With the Onion’s website, I noticed that a lot of their headers for the various types of stories such as the “Share”, “Trending”, "Recent News", “Explore Tags”, “Related Coverage”, and “Read More” are all outlined in bold with a deep green color. However, some of the other heading-like text such as "Continued on Next Page", along with a portion of the smaller subheadings (which look almost the exact same with the same bold lettering, font, and color) have a good number of them as clickable links. Additionally, a few of the small green icons next to the larger headers are also not clickable, meanwhile the small green icons which are standing alone are clickable for users.</li>

	     <li><h4><em>Framing One's Project into a Story-like Format to Refine Ideas:</em></h4>
	     <p>Through storytelling, ideas can often either begin to take root into a more static concept of a storyline- which can significantly clear up the fine direction in which one’s project will bloom into- or it can make it more clearer on what needs to be changed or removed to make the story flow more preferably, as the project ideas begins to face the challenges of formulating into a possible final product. For, like the article highlighted, stories often follow a pattern which ensures the overall success for the story, as it creates a format for the author to go in and follow as they try to reform their ideas to be as successfully attention engaging with the audience as they can. Additionally, following by the guidelines of a story-like format for one’s project ideas also allows for a clear space for one to sort through their ideas as they become more organized and refined, as well as accounts for the addition of meaningful emotion too (which is crucial to connect with both the targeted audience with the project and connects the creator to their own creation itself). Lastly, in the second part of the article, it was mentioned in a quote by Curt Cloninger that their view of narrative design allows for one to include a “voice” to accompany the creation of their ideas. I honestly agree with this sentiment because when formatting ideas into a collectively consecutive-like format as a way to frame the foundations of the project, it allows for the ideas to be put all on the same page which are all working together (rather than against or in all sorts of differing directions) to create the overall conclusion of the final version of the project.</p></li>
	    <li><h4>Various Ways to Establish Hierarchy & Emphasis in Typographic Design</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>When establishing either hierarchy or emphasis by utilizing design with the typography, it’s crucial to pay attention to the size of certain words or even letters so that it can either stand out as in the audience’s face, be so small that the viewer can barely glance at it, or can even just look like an average sized text to act as a supportive filler to back up the parts which are going to be emphasized. Furthermore, the size of the spacing between the lines or even the letters themselves can go to add a sense of hierarchy, as it acts well as an organizational tactic on a layout, as well as adds emphasis if used significantly amongst an array of other different looking text. Additionally, the colors and typeface styles can catch one’s attention too because, for example, utilizing a script font with elegant cursive will most likely stand out significantly amongst the regular looking and plain sans-serif type which can be adorning the rest of the layout.</li>
