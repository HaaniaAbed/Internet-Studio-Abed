	<h1>Krewella</h1>
	<p>Krewella was formed in 2007 by Pakistani-American sisters Jahan and Yasmine Yousaf, together with producer Kris Trindl. Jahan and Kris met at a Glenbrook North High School party in 2006. They were in a relationship; however, their relationship ended in 2011 and Kris Trindl ended up leaving the group, leaving Krewella to become a duo. As the duo's fame rose, their music became a blend of self-produced electro house and dubstep- with influences of many other EDM styles, including some samples with various styles of other genres added in such as rap. Over the years, after Trindl's depature from the band, this duo later went on to quickly climbing the steps to fame, and collaborations with various other growing artists.</p>
