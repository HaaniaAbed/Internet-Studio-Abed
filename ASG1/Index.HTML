	<h1>Assignment I</h1>
	<ol><li>Previously, I didn’t really know much about the three main phases of the Web’s evolution, so it was genuinely extremely interesting to learn more about each one of the phases, Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0</li><br />
<ul><li>For the Web 1.0 phase, I learned that this one was the initial stage that the Web passed through, which consisted of only a read-only style which shows information with very little to none interactability for the viewers.</li><br />
<li>For the Web 2.0 phase, I mainly learned that this stage was the phase where the web evolved more into its growing phase, where it allowed some participatory features for users. However, it was mainly the introduction of the evolution of websites and all of the features which they offer now.</li><br />
<li>For the Web 3.0 phase, I learned about how data got to the point where it got shared across the interface here, leading to the makings of a collective dataset, which all machine learning and artificial intelligence is drawing upon to gain understanding.</li></ul><br /><br />

<li>At first when I was reading and looking upon the graphics provided about decentralization in terms of data, I got a bit confused with all the information at first; however, it was honestly quite interesting to learn about how after the shift to a collective & connected web of data in Web 3.0, there may be possibility of the actual individual users being able to own their own data in the future, which would be more like a backwards walk from the connected data structure which Web 3.0 introduced after the two initial phases of the Web’s development over the years.</li><br /><br />

<li>The article, “Wax and Wane of the Web” provided a lot of interesting new information to me about all of the various types of tools that I’ve heard before in the past, but never really looked more deeper into what specifically they do in terms of their purpose, along with the timeline as to when they were developed & widely released for usage across the web. </li><br />
<ul><li>As an example, I learned about the origin of platforms & tools such as Blogger, Grey Matter, Movable Type, and Wordpress which were actually all early content management systems, which came up during the initial phases of the Web</li><br />
<li>There were also the later new tools which came up in the later phase that I got to know more about (which in the article, it sounds like it was introduced closer to the time of Web 3.0) such as React, Vue, and Angular which were advanced enough to allow wide ranges of users to fully be able to create their own fully functioning web software.</li>
