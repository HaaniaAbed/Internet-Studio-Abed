	<p>On Spotify, NateWantsToBattle is mainly a cover artist. He does double as a voice actor; however, a large majority of his songs are either just different versions of already pre-existing songs, or they are covers. I personally came across his work a few years ago, when I was first trying to figure out what sort of music I wanted to have on my playlists. I had a few songs in mind that were from my favorite video games that I wanted to have on the playlist so I went to use the search feature. At the time, I just knew the name of the song, along with the name of the game, rather than the name of the artist themselves too. So I ended up accidentally choosing some of NateWantsToBattle's songs in my playlist instead. I personally just did not like the way he added his own twist to the songs, also I felt like the way he would approach the vocals would completely change the mood of the song to more comedic rather than serious and action-like. At the time, I don't believe Spotify had added the official versions of those songs either so I was mainly annoyed with the fact that if I wanted to listen to that song, I had to listen to covers which weren't the most accurate in my option rather than the actual song.</p>
