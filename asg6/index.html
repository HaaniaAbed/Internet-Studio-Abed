	<h1>Six Thinking Hats</h1>
	<h2>White Hat:</h2>
	<p>Initially, I began with describing my idea of providing a safe place for people with more unique specifications regarding food to be able to turn to, in order to find aid or even just their like-minded community. We both discussed how a full list of all of the eating disorders (plus their definitions), a comprehensive database of all of the various allergies (along with some research done about what are the common effects this allergy can have on the individual), and a full list of all of the dietary restrictions that certain diets or religions can introduce to a follower of that lifestyle are all pieces of necessary information that needs to first and foremost be researched in depth. We also talked about the different sites to go to get this information such as official medical journals and even cross checking multiple sources to ensure the information is more uniform.
</p>
	<h2>Red Hat:</h2>
	<p>I then went into detail of my mixed feelings regarding this website. For, I mentioned that a website such as this would be of significant use to me personally if it could be tailored to all of my highly specific specifications and my friend agreed that overall this website could provide a feeling of relief to someone who may be struggling. However, we both also went into depth, speaking about how there were risks with some of the more specifics of how this website would work with questions about moderation of the more community parts of this website. We discussed that while it could be a great resource, it would have to be restricted by a strict code of rules and regulations when it comes to the interactive portion of this website so no one could exploit it and make the overall environment of this website feel more unsafe.
</p>
	<h2>Black Hat:</h2>
	<p>There was the idea of making this more like a blog and my friend brought up the idea of making this app like Instagram, where one could post a recipe or a picture of what they are eating and have others interact with it. However, like we discovered earlier when we were getting into talking about the feelings for the Red hat, the potential problems and risks would be leaving this website exposed to the risk of being turned into a place of negativity, like Instagram’s comment section nowadays. So overall, the idea of having this website be too interactive doesn’t fit within the safe zone of making sure that this website doesn’t stray away from its first and foremost goal of ensuring that this is a safe place for those with more unique food-related experiences. Also, because this app will be mainly catering to also people with eating disorders, generally on pre-existing public social platforms, it’s already been proven that there is an audience of people who decide to bring people down because of their food-related struggles. So, my friend and I discussed that we would have to be extremely careful and make this website as strict as possible to not attract those sorts of comments for such a delicate topic.
</p>
	<h2>Yellow Hat:</h2>
	<p>Now, while there are the struggles of especially the users with food disorders being able to find safety in this app because of them widely getting attacked or ridiculed on various other instances on various other social public platforms, my friend and I talked about how this quality would actually overall contribute to the success of this website even more if it were to be successfully implemented. For, the value that this website would provide, would be a safe community place that is not widely found anywhere else on the other various social platforms. So, as a result, to make this website work, my friend and I discussed about how it would indeed have to not only be strict but have an area for reporting people, blocking, banning, often moderations of the community spaces, and an area for people to reach out to the website themselves to request changes be made for the overall improvement in safety. These qualities could provide the reassurance to users that this place is extremely dedicated to providing a safe place for the most comfort, which would come across as quite attractive to someone who wishes for that level of safety with these sorts of topics.
</p>
	<h2>Green Hat:</h2>
	<p>My friend brought up the idea of having this website be more visuals based, rather than text based. For, moderating text could take a long time which could result in uncomfortable words being left alone for a while before it is found then removed. Additionally, since slang changes quite often, it would be hard to also make sure that all of the offending words will be removed because on the surface, it could look harmless but in reality, to a specific culture of people, it could mean something else entirely. So we both discussed the alternative idea that in order for this app to be more useful in the long term, images would be more of an easier and straightforward way to moderate safety. We could change the idea of the blog and have it go with the idea of Instagram slightly, but we could change up the direction to just having more visual communication. Furthermore, having more of a visual communication style on this website could also ensure that people from all areas of the planet and who speak all sorts of languages would be able to easily use this app, despite their reading abilities or their ability to speak a particular language that everyone else seems to be using on the app. 
</p>
	<h2>Blue Hat:</h2>
	<p>My friend and I just re-capped the goal of this website to first and foremost provide a safe place for people who struggle uniquely with food can be able to turn into or even give advice to aid others' experiences. We also recapped the ideas of researching as much as possible about all of the various sorts of the more unique food related experiences as the target subject within the large public audience, and tailoring this website to cater more to their comfort needs by the use of moderating and having an area for users to reach out with their feedback to the website themselves.
</p>
	<h2>Summary:</h2>
	<p>As a result of this discussion, my project has been reshaped in the form of becoming more of a visual based platform, from my original plan of making it more text based (or blog-like). Additionally, my friend gave me the idea of looking at pre-existing social media platforms to get an idea of good ways to show visual based interactions on the website which will also attract certain age demographics more too, by the use of good and appealing styles. I’ve also gotten more of a clearer idea of ideas to keep and how to implement more of the moderation for this website’s community option so that users can remain feeling safe while using this platform.   </p>
