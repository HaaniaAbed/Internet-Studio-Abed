	<h2>>Rose</h2>
	<p>As my first guest of honor, I would like to invite Rose because she is my sister. <br />
		She has been my sister ever since I was around 14. Furthermore, we’re actually not<br />
		biologically related, yet she still took me in. She’s made sure to be there for me <br />
		throughout every major milestone in my life, regardless of what it was. In conclusion, <br />
		she was always there for me with no strings attached and I tried my best to be there<br />
		as equally for her too over the years.</p>

	<h2>>Knox</h2>
	<p>As my second guest of honor, I would like to invite my eldest sibling, Knox.<br />
		Like Rose, Knox isn't actually biologically related to me, yet they still <br />
		made as much of an effort as they could to be a supportive and caring figure<br /> 
		in my life. Honestly, to me, Knox was always more of a parental figure despite <br />
		their relative closeness in age to me. Initially, I met both Rose and Knox by chance <br />
		in the same area. While I wasn’t immediately as close with Knox, over time (and with<br />
		Rose’s help), Knox and I became extremely close friends. </p>

	<h2>>Ignor</h2>
	<p>As for the last (but certainly not least) guest of honor for this dinner<br />
		invite, I would like to extend the invitation to Ignor (Ignor isn’t his<br />
		real name, it’s just the first part of his username). Like Rose and Knox,<br />
		I met him by chance on September 26, 2024. However, despite the completely<br />
		random meeting of initially speaking about Mario Kart and being whacked with<br />
		Blue Shells, he’s become an incredibly important part of my life as I’ve gotten<br />
		the opportunity to speak with him for this past year daily. I believe the two<br />
		of us are extremely similar in personality too, so it’s quite nice for me personally<br />
		to be able to speak with someone who shares a lot of my ideals and values.</p>
