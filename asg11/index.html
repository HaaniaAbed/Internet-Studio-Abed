      <h3>Hyou</h3>
      <p>For my dodgeball team, I believe that Hyou from the Kingdom movie series would be a great option for one of the team members due to his expertise in ancient chinese warfare tactics. He originally was chosen to be the body double in order to protect the king of the Chinese state kingdom of Qin, then used his excellence in warfare and overseeing the troops as a general to save the king and court’s lives in the first movie. Hyou’s great skills of a general would be highly beneficial in acting as this dodgeball team’s leader and strategist, due to his vast intellect in warfare skills.

      <h3>Jim Hawkins</h3>
        <p>Additionally, Jim Hawkins from the movie, Treasure Planet, would be a beneficial addition to the team due to his vast aviation engineering abilities and his knack for breaking the rules. He would fit perfectly with the rest of the team of the Crimson Rogue Titans, and overall improve the team’s ability to get along and find a common ground. For, Jim Hawkins shares the similar intellect and passion as everyone else on the team, however he also crucially has compassion which will make him the foundation, holding the rest of the team together. He also will aid the games in making them more fun by utilizing his aviation engineering skills to win the games at any cost in a highly intellectual way.

      <h3>Red Hood</h3>
        <p>The Red Hood from the movie, Batman Under the Red Hood, would be a great option for me to include in my dodgeball team due to his vast fighting and parkour skills. The Red Hood, originally known as Jason Todd/the second Robin (after Dick Grayson became Nightwing) before his rebirth, was trained directly under Batman and later was trained under Rai’s Al Ghul in the League of Assassins after his rebirth. In the movie, he also demonstrated an incredible display of parkour skills which surpassed even Batman’s abilities. Due to his vast skills in fighting and especially parkour, he would be a great candidate to help dodge the balls in dodgeball and fight back to the other team.

       <h3>Sunshine (Ronnie Bass)</h3>
         <p>Sunshine (aka The Football legend Ronnie Bass) from history and the movie, Remember the Titans, is a great runner, which was why he was originally added to the football team as an additional key player. Like the Red Hood, he would excel in being able to utilize his football and running skills to expertly dodge the balls and fight on the offense. He also has experience in actual sports, rather than warfare or crime-fighting which the others excel in, so he will be able to aid the others in adapting to reality and modern times, which will overall boost team morale.
